#### Haul is a datapack that lets the player pick up and move chests and barrels! Simply stand next to the chest or barrel, sneak, and right click! The block will disappear and will be placed into your inventory. You can then place it back down wherever you want!

#### Having a chest or barrel in your inventory will give you slowness, they're heavy! Trying to carry more than one will stop you from moving or jumping altogether.
